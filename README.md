# Excel IP Functions

## A Suite of Excel Tools to manipulate IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in Microsoft Excel.

These tools are a useful tool for anyone who needs to interact with IP addresses in any forms. They can help you with such queries:
- What is the network address, subnet mask or broadcast address?
- What is the next or previous subnet?
- I need a list of subnets in a summary?
- Is an address or network in a multicast or private range?

These tools help you answer all of those queries and many, many more.

There are now two versions of the tools available.

__NEW IN 2025: IP Formulas__

I have now developped a formula based suite of functions to manipulate IPv4 addresses.
There are two major benefits to the formula based suite:
- They run on Excel Online
- They run in standard .xls workbooks, no need for a .xlsm macro enabled workbook

They do support most features from formatting to sorting and subnetting.

The two main restrictions:
- They required Excel 365
- They only support IPv4

__Classic VBA Based Functions__

If you do need to manipulate IPv6 addresses, or use an older version of Excel, my classic VBA based fucntions are still available.

They do support IPv4 and IPv6.
