# Excel IP Functions

## A Suite of Excel Tools to manipulate IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in Microsoft Excel.

NEW IN 2025: IP Formulas

I have now developped a formula based suite of functions to manipulate IP addresses without using VBA.
They do support most features from formatting, to sorting and subnetting.

They are however restricted:
- They required Excel 365
- They only support IPv4

Classic VBA Based Functions

The classic VBA based fucntions are still available.

They do support IPv4 and IPv6.
